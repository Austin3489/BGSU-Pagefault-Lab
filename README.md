# BGSU-Pagefault-Lab
The idea behind this lab was to identify which page fault algorithm performs better than the other under a given set of frames, using LRU(Least Recently Used) and FiFo(First in First out) algorithms. </br>
Language used: C++ </br>
The lab shows the number of page faults each algorithm has with 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 frames. </br>
The output is meant to show the frame number that has the minimum number of page faults and reports that number along with the algorithm.
